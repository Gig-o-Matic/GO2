Description: 
        gae-pytz
        ========
        pytz has a severe performance problem that impedes its usage on Google App
        Engine. This is caused because pytz.__init__ builds a list of available
        zoneinfos checking the entire zoneinfo database (which means: it tries to open
        hundreds of files). This is done in the module globals, so it is not easily
        avoidable. And it is far from ideal to do this in App Engine - app
        initialization becomes unacceptable if every time we import pytz it checks
        500+ files.
        
        In this alternative version, pytz is highly optimized for App Engine, following
        ideas from several recipes around:
        
        - database files are not automatically reads when the module is imported
        - the database files are loaded using zipimport to reduce number of files
        - it uses memcache to cache already loaded zoneinfos
        
        This results in almost unnoticeable load time and makes pytz usable on App
        Engine.
